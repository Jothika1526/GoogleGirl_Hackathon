STEPS TO USE THE CODE 

1. input_reports.ipynb : This code is to generate all the input reports . If you want to create a new report you can add them under the report_content variable. (Note : This is not a part of the final app. This is only to create the input that is required for the final app)

2. app_code.ipynb : This code has 4 parts

a) 1st section : OCR extraction . The extracted text is saved to extracted_reports.txt in same directory
b) 2nd section : The fine-tuned AI model which gives the summarized output . The output in the form of text is stored in summary_report.txt in same directory
c) 3rd section : This is a model to separate the summary_report.txt content into key-value pairs for formatting the pdf . This is just for formatting and to give an appealing output. The output is stored in key_value.txt in same directory.
d) 4th section : This part takes the key_value.txt as input and gives the output as a structured pdf file. The pdf file is saved as clinical_report_bullet.pdf in same directory

NOTE : the other files in this folder are the example input files i have generated

If all input files are ready just start running app_code.ipynb
1. Run the whole code and give all the input file directories as input.
2. Once thats done you can immediately get the final output and the intermediate text files as mentioned earlier.

If new input files are required you can use input_reports.ipynb to create them.

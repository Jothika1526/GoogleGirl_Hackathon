Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Report

Name: John Smith
Age: 56
Date of Birth: 1968-05-15
Gender: Male

Chief Complaints:
Chest pain radiating to the left arm
Intermittent chest pressure
Shortness of breath
Dizziness and lightheadedness
Episodes of fatigue
Occasional palpitations

Vital Signs:
Blood Pressure: Ranged from 145/90 mmHg to 150/95 mmHg
Heart Rate: Ranged from 88 bpm to 92 bpm
Respiratory Rate: Ranged from 20 to 22 breaths/min
Temperature: 98.6째F - 98.7째F

Physical Examination:
Cardiovascular: Systolic murmur detected at the lower sternal border during the initial examination, with regular heart rhythm. No further abnormalities noted in later evaluations.
Neurological: No focal neurological deficits observed. Cranial nerves II-XII intact throughout evaluations.

Diagnosis:
Stable angina with possible coronary artery disease, warranting further investigation and testing (e.g., exercise tolerance test).

Treatment Recommendations:
Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for blood pressure management
Metoprolol 25 mg once daily for heart rate control and symptom relief
Nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain
Cardiac rehabilitation referral
Treadmill stress test to evaluate exercise tolerance and heart function
Referral to cardiology for further evaluation
Follow-Up Instructions:
Return for reevaluation and to review results of the stress test. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor angina and cardiovascular status.
